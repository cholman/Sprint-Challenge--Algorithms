#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

    O(n)
    runs through the while loop once for each n

b)

    O(n)

    it runs O(n*3) simplified to O(n)

c)

    O(1)

    runs once no matter what n is
## Exercise II


n-stories

egg breaks above floor f, below f doesn't break

break the least number of eggs to determine floor f

Loop through n stories, dropping an egg each time:

for n in stories:
    if egg_broken == true
        return

this is a time complexity of O(n)
